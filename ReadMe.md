<p>Visit the website at <a href="shoptracker.eu">shoptracker.eu</a></p>

<p>ShopTracker is all about keeping track of your expenses, no matter what kind or what currency. Add every purchase you make to one of your groups - it's just that simple. Then at any time you can browse your purchases, filter, sort or search that particular item you bought.</p>

<p>Currently, ShopTracker.eu has the basic working abilities - you can sign up, login, make groups, add your purchases, sort/filter/search for particular purchases, add new items, add new categories and measures for the items. But it lacks an overall good look and some performance issues. That's why it is in beta. The 1.0 version is comming soon!</p>
